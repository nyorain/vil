# Feature support overview

Even when a feature/extension isn't explicitly supported by the layer,
there are good chances that it might just work. If you plan on using
extensions not explicitly supported, make sure to set the `VIL_WRAP=0`
environment variable, it will significantly increase the chance that 
new extensions "just work", with a slight performance hit. 
See [env.md](env.md) for more details.

## Vulkan 1.0

Missing:
- Anything with sparse/aliasing memory: not implemented/tested at all, 
  will likely cause failed assert/crash in layer

## Vulkan 1.1

Implemented:
- VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template
- VK_KHR_bind_memory2
- VK_KHR_bind_memory2
- vkCmdDispatchBase
- vkTrimCommandPool
- VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation (not indicated in ui yet though)

Missing:
- Anything with device masks is missing; using it will very likely crash.
- no support for render pass multiview, VK_KHR_multiview
- no support for protected submit
- ui: for YCbCr conversion handles not tracked/shown
- ui: no support for variable pointers buffer
- external memory, fences, semaphores
- KHR_maintenance2
	- using the renderpass/imageView extensions might crash

## Vulkan 1.2

Implemented:
- vkCmdDrawIndirectCount & vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCount should not cause crashes
- VK_KHR_create_renderpass2

Missing:
- vkCmdDrawIndirectCount & vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCount has incomplete gui
  support, especially vertex viewer needs improvement
- timeline semaphores
- descriptor indexing: support incomplete. Viewing a command that uses
  descriptor sets with descriptor indexing may cause problems in some
  cases.
- no support for imageless_framebuffer
- no render pass extensions supported

## Non-core extensions

Extensions promoted to core not explicitly mentioned here, see above.
Supported extensions:

- VK_KHR_copy_commands2
- KHR_swapchain
- VK_EXT_debug_utils
- KHR_surface (tested overlay platforms: xlib, xcb, win32)
	- other platforms should work without crash at least

supported but no/incomplete gui interaction/information:
- VK_EXT_conditional_rendering 
- VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state
- VK_EXT_line_rasterization
- VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate
- VK_KHR_push_descriptor
- VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template
- VK_KHR_draw_indirect_count
- VK_EXT_sample_locations
- VK_EXT_discard_rectangles

## NOTES: 
- vendor-specific extensions are generally not a focus, unless someone
  is interested in them and writes the code or sponsors someone to do it.
- the layer does not have support for VK_EXT_debug_report/VK_EXT_debug_marker 
  and will likely not add it in the future, either, as it is deprecated. 
  Just use debug_utils, it's a better replacement.
- support VK_KHR_device_group in the near future is unlikely since making it
  work with our concepts is not trivial
- support VK_EXT_transform_feedback in the near future is unlikely as the
  layer itself is using it for the vertex viewer (which would conflict with
  an application-side use of it). It's only supposed to be used by tools/layers
  anyways.

- Extensions that have significant changes to command recording (such as
  new pipeline bind points or new commands) will very likely always lead to
  significant problems. Implementing basic support for them isn't complicated
  though
