Moved from todo.md. Mostly ideas for experiments that might not even
be possible or useful in the end.

For shader capture debugging:
- can we support capturing images/samples/buffers/RayTracingAccelStructs
      and other types? Allowed in quite some high-level languages.
	  I have no idea how this could work though, we have no useful
	  information in the shader... Maybe somehow track which binding
	  ID (+array ID) this resource is. But that sounds like a lot of work
- support for stepping?
      meh, I think what we have is more powerful and intuitive than
	  the traditional approach. It feels "live", as it is.
	- but current approach limited for loops/control flow following
	  loops: allow to specify a "counter", how often control should
	    have been at the cursor before output is written.
		Alternatively: just write output for each iteration.
		(we can then still do fancy viz stuff on the cpu with the data)
	  how can we visualize control flow *live*?
	    maybe it's already enough that no output is shown when a section
		is not reached.

- matching on indirect commands can be hard since we don't know their
  actual parameters. Could always retrieve their data (in many cases possible
  without hooking; if the data segment isn't written/made undefined by that command buffer
  itself before *and* after the draw command, we can simply insert our own
  commandBuffer before/afterwards). And then match on that data.
- to get command timings of whole commandbuffers (or whole submissions),
  don't hook anything. Instead just insert our own command buffers
  (before and after) into the submission stream where we write out timestamps

- (low prio) add also full batch (e.g. vkQueueSubmit/vkQueueBindSparse) timings? 
  Would require custom cb recording on our side

- When clicking on a flag, extension name or something, link to vulkan api spec
  regarding that item? Not sure how easy to do.
  Also e.g. for enabled extensions, features, etc.
  	- maybe doing it on *every* click is annoying, only do it with some
	  modifier, e.g. ctrl or something.
- serialize command records. At least roughly, without referenced handles
  and stuff
  	- beside visualization, this would make debugging easier, allowing
	  to use specific (complex) records in the unit tests for reproduction
	  and debugging
	- would also allow to store a specific position inside a record/the frame
	  to quickly navigate to it between multiple application starts.
	  This one is even more tricky though, deciding which data to serialize.
	  Probably wouldn't want to rely on stack traces here, right?

- allow to visualize buffers as images where it makes sense
  (using a bufferView or buffer-to-image copy)

- use dynamic rendering as renderpass splitting fallback?
  we'd have to recreate the pipeline as well tho. And can't support
  input attachments. Hm ok probably wont work
  	- Could do it on pipeline creation time when no resolve/input
	  attachments are used? But that might have performance impact
	- The renderpass splitting approach is hacky, error-prone, hard
	  to debug. So finding an alternative here (and dynamic rendering
	  sounds promising) would make sense and be worth it.

- add option to automatically write some specific pattern into images/buffers
  on initialization, making it easier to detect uninitialized memory usage

- explore what random stuff we are able to do
	- Visualize models (drawcalls) on its own by inferring
	  position (and possibly other attribs; hard to infer though, could use heuristics
	  but should probably let user just flag them explicitly)
	- Infer projection and view matrix, allow to manipulate them.
	  We could add our entirely own camera to any game, allowing free movement
	  in the world (likely glitched due to culling and stuff but that's still interesting).
	  Hard to infer the correct matrix, might rely on manual user flagging.
	- Infer as much general information as possible. When annotations are
	  missing automatically annotate handles and the command buffer
	  as good as possible. We are likely able to detect depth-only (should probably
	  even be able to develop good heuristics to decide shadow vs preZ), gbuffer,
	  shading, post-processing passes. Might also be able to automatically infer
	  normal/diffuse/other pbr maps (harder though).
	- use heuristics to identify interesting constants in ubo/pcr/shader itself
	  (interesting as in: big effect on the output). Expose them as parameters
	  in the gui.

- Allow modifying resources (temporarily or permanently)
	- in command viewer or resource viewer
	- over such a mechanism we could implement a forced camera

- optimization: instead of copying resources in commandHook, implement
  copy-on-write. Only when this submission (or some other pending one)
  is potentially writing something, copy it. Otherwise, copy it before
  future submissions that might write it (if still needed)

- add submission log! possibility to track what submissions are done
  during startup, another thing that's hard to track with capturing
  we just create a second window by default?
  If a manual overlay is created later on, we can still close the window
  and move the gui. Could also wait for first submission/swapchain
  creation (if swapchain ext is enabled) with creating/showing the window

- add anti-aliasing to vertex viewer. Should probably be beautifully
  be doable with TAA
  	- could also add AO to vertex viewer, when rendering faces

- add a "force render-order" feature since it can be a pain in the ass
  to continuously debug draw commands when their order randomly changes
  (have seen it multiple times in games). Not sure if feasible though to
  force/reorder on our side.

- allow to show contents of *any* resource before/after *any* command.
  Useful debugging memory corruptions & aliasing.

- allow to save image/buffer data to file

- time critical functions: Gui::Draw, command hook recording, freeBlocks etc
  and track them via DebugStats. When they get too large show something
  via imgui in debug mode (e.g. the needed time in red).

- hide shader debugger behind config feature?
	- adds a whole new library and isn't ready yet at all.
	  and might never really be ready, it's more of an experiment anyways

quick local-command capture

During recording already, we can tell vil *somehow* that we are
interested in *this* command (maybe pass flags, e.g. say that we are
interested in shader debugging).

When opening the UI (even if that's way later), we can then select
the last capture of this particular command (e.g. associated with
name via API).
Shouldn't be too hard via current api.

The hardest part is the notification via api I guess.
We can't just pass a VkCommandBuffer into vil api.
Could store per-thread last recorded CommandBuffer but that introduces
some overhead while recording; would like to avoid.

Hm, maybe we can use some specific debug label names?
E.g. if you begin insert a debug utils label called "VilCaptureNext"
	(and then possibly some more arguments into the string)
we store inside the commandbuffer that the next command should be marked.

Wait, we don't even support InsertDebugUtilsLabel rn. brb.
	btw, we would want this for BeginDebugUtilsLabel as well, often
	the main thing used, might be the only thing supported/easily accessible
	in engine

```cpp
struct LocalCapture {
	std::string name;
	IntrusivePtr<CommandRecord> record;
	std::vector<const Command*> commands;
	bool once {};
};

```

- reintroduce the "Focus Selected" checkbox (and feature) in CommandBufferGui
  it just needs some love
