# Notes and discussion

All of these are personal notes, discussions, ideas and sketches for the layer.
Many of the concepts are vastly outdated or were already integrated into the
layer (often in a slightly or very different form) and the notes are just kept 
around for personal reference.

You probably don't want to make sense of these things if you are not me :)
