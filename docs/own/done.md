- [x] respect ds dynamic offsets. Test with SW sample
- [x] fix IO viewer being stuck because we can't get a new command
      {still not fixed, even when using LCS & new update logic}
	- [x] fix dlg_assert(found), gui/cb.cpp
	- [x] use/implement LCS and better general strategy when in swapchain mode for
		  command matching/finding the best hook from last frame
- [x] alternative view of DeviceMemory showing a better visualization of
      the resources placed in it (and the empty space)
- [x] proper shipping and installing
	- [x] make the json file a config file, generated by meson
	- [x] write wiki post on how to build/install/use it
	- [x] fix for vil_api.h: should probably load *real* name of library (generated
	      via meson), not some guesswork.
	      Important on windows, to support all compilers. See TODO on lib name there.
		  OTOH this would make vil_api.h depend on some generated stuff which
		  is bad as well.
		  {added a define}
- [x] detect when variables like Builtin CullDistance are present in spirv
      but never written - we don't have to show them in the xfb tab.
	  We don't even have to capture them in the first place.
- [x] vertex viewer: better tabular display of data; also show indices. Respect offset
- [x] vertex viewer improvements
	- [x] automatically compute bounding box of data and center camera
	- [x] allow showing active frustum
- [x] vertexViewer: support drawIndirectCount in vertex viewer
	- [x] similar: support drawIndirect with multiple commands
- [x] vertexViewer: also support just showing a single draw command of multiDraw
	  (see the other todo on showing attachments/ds state per-draw)
- [x] fix cbGui freeze: temporarily unfreeze when selecting a new command
      I guess we can only handle this in the cbGui itself. Just set a flag
	  that commandHook.freeze is set to false until we get a new state
- [x] the shown commands (of vkQueueSubmit) are not updated when no command
      is selected?
- [x] xfb: consider spec constants. Store them in created module, might
      hook xfb multiple times, for different spec constants.
- [x] xfb, vertex viewer: consider dynamically set stride when pipeline has that dynamic state
- [x] xfb: support custom outputs, not just the Position Builtin
- [x] fix 3D vertex viewer for 2D position data (needs separate shader I guess)
	  {nope, it doesn't. Using vec4 input with r32g32_sfloat attribute is valid}
- [x] (easy) don't lock the dev mutex during our spirv xfb injection.
      Could e.g. always already generate it when the shader module
	  is created.
- [x] fix hooking commands inside CmdExecuteCommands
	  I guess CmdExecuteCommands should not do anything in record()?
	  We have to watch out for extensions there though
- [x] the current situation using imgui_vil is terrible. We need this to make
      sure that imgui symbols we define don't collide with the symbols
	  from the application. The proper solution is to set symbol_visibility
	  to hidden. But then we can't test vil. Maybe just export the stuff
	  we test explicitly? Same for spirv_reflect basically.
	  {can be removed in future, we don't export symbols anymore}
- [x] commandHook: See the TODO on 'completed'. Might create problems atm.
- [x] fix commandHook for updateAfterBind, updateUnusedWhilePending.
      We might need to invalidate the hooked records when a used descriptor
	  was changed
- [x] the performance notes in CommandHook::hook are relevant
- [x] rework dev/gui so that there is never more than one gui. Supporting
      multiple guis at the same time is not worth the trouble (think
	  about command buffer hooking from multiple cb viewers...)
	- [x] what to do when window *and* overlay is created? or multiple overlays?
		  Should probably close the previous one (move gui object)
		  See todo in Gui::init. Make sure there never is more than one
- [x] should support image-less framebuffer extension as soon as possible,
	  might need a lot of changes {it didn't but uncovered a bug in secondary cbs}
- [x] Add more useful overview. 
	- [x] Maybe directly link to last submitted command buffers?
	      {this is kinda shitty though, need the concept of command buffer groups
		   to make this beautiful}
	- [x] show graph of frame timings (see first sketch swapchain header)
	- [x] show enabled extensions
	- [x] show enabled features
	- [x] only show application info if filled out by app. collapse by default?
- [x] implement mechanism for deciding per-handle-type whether object wrapping
      should be done. Either via GUI or env var. 
	  Performance-wise it's only really important for
	  CommandBuffers and DescriptorSets (technically also for Device but
	  that pretty much guarantees that 50% of new extensions will crash).
- [x] bump api version as far as possible when creating instance?
      not sure if anything could go wrong in practice
- [x] insert command buffer timing queries
- [x] track query pools
- [x] track buffer views
- [x] should probably not be possible to ever unselect ParentCommands in
      cb viewer (CommandTypeFlags). Just always display them?
- [x] CommandMemBlock alignment handling might currently be wrong since
      we don't take the alignment of the beginning of the mem block into account,
	  might be less than __STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT__ due to obj size.
	  Handle it as we do in ThreadMemBlock
- [x] when we select a resource of type X should we set the current filter to X
      in the resource gui? Can be somewhat confusing at the moment
- [x] figure out how to correctly match swapchain.frameSubmissions to the
	  commandHook state. See TODO in cb.cpp `dlg_assert(found)`
- [x] when there are multiple commands with the same match value, choose
      the one with the smaller difference in Command.relID?
	  Or (more properly; harder to determine) just go by order then.
- [x] make sure the environment variables for overlays/window creation work
      as specified in readme everywhere
- [x] resource viewer: we don't know which handle is currently selected
      (in the window on the left), can get confusing when they don't have names.
	  Should probably be an ImGui::Selectable (that stays selected) instead
	  of a button
- [x] remove CommandGroups? Just rely on command matching instead?
      figure out how to properly do matching across command buffer
	  boundaries; taking the context - the position inside a frame - into account
- [x] currently command groups *interfer* with our new, improved command matching
      since it may not recognize two records as being in the same group
	  when they should be (and we would find a perfect command match).
	  Another point for removing them in their current form; as a requirement
	  for command matching
	  {yep, just removed them}
- [x] make sure we fulfill multithreading requirements for
      VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT and friends
	  {should work with out current DescriptorSet, State separation}
- [x] (important) the way we copy/modify descriptor set states might have
      a data race at the moment. When copying, we might try to increase
	  the reference count of an already destroyed State object (when it is
	  currently being replaced?)
- [x] (important) the way we currently copy vectors of IntrusivePtr handles
      outside the lock (e.g. in Gui) to make they don't get destroyed inside
	  isn't threadsafe
- [x] {high prio} the many shared locks when recording a cb can be harmful as well.
      We could get around this when wrapping handles, should probably
	  look into that eventually (maybe allow to switch dynamically at
	  runtime since wrapping makes supporting new extensions out of the
	  box highly unlikely so users could fall back to hash tables at
	  the cost of some performance).
- [x] identified bottleneck (e.g. with dota): the device mutex for DescriptorSetState.
      Should be possible to give each DescriptorSetState its own mutex.
	  Hm, might still be a problem that we update so many links between
	  resources (ds <-> cb and ds <-> view).
	  Could still try to use a linked grid for those links, could possibly
	  even make that completely lockfree.
	  Maybe we can even get rid of ds <-> cb links? That would help.
	  - [x] ideally, we would have no (non-local) locks during descriptor
			set updating {well, duh, we still have to lock when creating
			a new state object but that should be fine as it shouldn't
			happen often}
	- [x] ideally, we would have *no* locks during command recording at all
	      {almost there, have no locks for most commands}
- [x] add tracy for profiling
- [x] clean and split up QueueSubmit implementation. It's way too long,
      does way too much. And will probably further grow
	- [x] also: always check in the beginning for finished submissions
- [x] when there is more than one record of the same group in one RecordBatch we get
      into troubles when viewing it in swapchain commands mode.
	  The problem is that *all* group submissions update hook.state and we might end
	  up viewing one of those states, not really the one we want.
	  Which can lead to weird issues, e.g. the gui shows a depthStencil attachment
	  but when we click it we see a color attachment. Not sure how to really fix this,
	  probably use more information in swapchain mode (e.g. submission order) and
	  improve matching in general (e.g. make sure that render pass attachments *must* match
	  for command group/records matching)
	  {~semi-done with the new command matching system, still missing
	   better command groups and command group sequence matching, but
	   there are new todos for that}
- [x] proper rasterization introspection using transform feedback.
      we already query in the device whether it's supported
	- [x] requires SPIR-V hooking (only execution mode setting and adding xfb to outputs)
	      have to do it to all pipelines though I guess.
		  Not supported with multiview, respect that (via renderpass)
	- [x] capture in on our side into buffers
	- [x] not sure if we need the transform feedback queries or if we
	      can always deduce that information statically
		  {we have the information statically in all cases so far}
- [~] might be better to determine command group at EndCommandBuffer
      instead of first submission. We can't use the used queue though...
	  {nope, it's not, the command group concept is mainly a hack in the
	   first place}
- [x] stress test using a real vulkan-based game. Test e.g. with doom eternal
	- [x] vkQuake2
	- [x] doom eternal
		- [x] figure out how to make multi-submission drawing easily viewable
		      -> per-frame-commands cb viewer mode
	- [x] dota 2 (linux)
	- (also tried out rdr2 in the meantime)
- [x] before release: test on windows & linux, on all owned hardware
- [x] Allow to freeze state for current displayed command, i.e. don't
      update data from hook
	- [x] figure out how to communicate this via gui.
	      This is a distinct option form the "displayed commands source" and UpdateMode
	- [x] While at it, clean up all the hook logic for io viewer
		  {refactored to gui CommandViewer}
- [x] test `splittable` impl for render passes. There are very likely issues.
      (especially for the cases where render pass can't be split)
	  {see docs/test/rpsplit.cpp, seems to work in basic cases}
- [x] fix debug utils label hierachy. They could have been started/completed
      in different command buffer
	  {note that there is still a remaning issue as we can't currently
	   track queue-pushed/popped lables correctly, see todo.md}
- [x] allow to select in cb viewer which commands are shown
	- [x] make that more compact/intuitive if possible
	- [x] looks really ugly at the moment, improve that.
	      maybe move to own settings tab? Wouldn't expect people to change
		  it often tbh
	- [x] cleanest would probably a button that spawns a popup/dialog
	      in which this can be selected. That is possible with ImGui,
		  see BeginPopup.
		  Alternatively move it to a general settings tab (that we kind of
		  need by now).
	- [x] Improve the "Freeze state" checkbox, it vastly out of place rn
- [x] fix resource viewer
	- [x] fix filtering by type
	- [x] fix filtering by name
- [x] xfb: use heuristic to figure out if ortho or perspective projection is used
	- [x] and then use the matching shader (i.e. scaled w vs scaled z as view-space z coord)
	- [x] probably best to have one vertex shader controlled via push constant
- [x] fix Gui::draws_ synchronization issue
	  See Gui::pendingDraws (called from queue while locked) but also
	  Gui::finishDraws (e.g. called from CreateSwapchain without lock,
	  potential race!)
	  {NOTE: there are likely a couple more sync issues for Gui stuff}
- [x] make queues viewable handles
	- [x] allow to view command groups per queue
- [x] take VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::timestampComputeAndGraphics into account
	  for inserting query commands (check for the queue family in general,
	  we might not be able to use the query pool!).
	  {we don't need that limit, it's a general guarantee. We just check per-qfam}
- [x] in io & resource viewer: mip slider broken
	- [x] Also move to own line? or just make half width?
- [x] Rename FUEN_ macros into VIL_
- [x] automatically update resource lists in resource gui when tab is re-entered
      from somewhere else
- [x] improve enumString
	- [x] make enumString.hpp return some deafult value ("" or "<?>") instead of nullptr.
		  Could cause crashed for future values atm
	- [x] better enumString.hpp. Remove prefixes
	- [x] get VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN into enumString.hpp (and check if other enum values are missing for some reason)
	      (the vk.xml we used was just too old. Shows how important updating it)
- [x] always use nearest sampling for images?
- [x] add example image to readme (with real-world application if possible)
- [x] probably rather important to have a clear documentation on supported
      feature set, extensions and so on
	  {see docs/features.md}
	- [x] clearly document (maybe already in README?) that the layer
	      can crash when extensions it does not know about/does not support
		  are being used.
	- [x] update README to correctly show all current features
- [x] proper layout of child windows with resizing
      See https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/319
	  {just switched to the new imgui tables, they fix issues}
- [x] show more information in command viewer. Stuff downloaded from
      device before/after command
	  {some TODOs of this feature moved to after v0.1}
	- [x] new per-command input/output overview, allowing to view *all* resources
	- [x] I/O inspector for transfer commands
	      {left buffer gui io support for later}
	- [x] add more information to I/O viewer (especially for images)
	- [x] fix code flow. Really bad at the moment, with Commands calling
	      that displayAction function and optionally append to child.
	- [x] improve the new overview. See all the various todos
	      {still lots of TODOs left though, just most important ones fixed now}
	- [x] chose sensible default sizes/layouts
	- [x] implement buffer viewer (infer information from shaders)
	- [x] factor out image viewer from resources into own component; use it here.
	      Allow layer/mip selection
	- [x] re-add timing display in command inspector
	- [x] display arrays in buffers correctly
	      {moved to spirv todo}
	- [x] for storage buffers/storage images, a before/after/change
	      view would be really nice. We can do that.
- [x] Fix the (due to table now broken) append child logic in displayInspector
	- [x] should likely call displayActionInspector directly from inside cbGui
	      and only show command inspector itself when "Command" is selected
- [x] selecting cmdBeginRp in gui gives validation layer error.
      I suspect we try to split it or something?
	  {nope we didn't split but still inserted splitting barrier, not allowed}
- [x] Link to swapchain in swapchain images
- [x] next ui sync rework
	- [x] don't lock device mutex while waiting for fences (see waitForSubmissions)
	- [x] use chain semaphores for input
	- [x] correctly sync output, but only if it's needed (might work already)
	      {i guess is application calls vkQueuePresentKHR we trust it knows
		   what it is doing?}
	- [x] if timeline semaphores are available, use them! for all submissions (in and out)
		- [x] when timeline semaphore extension is available, enable it!
	- [x] insert barrier at end of each submission, optimize case where application
	      uses same queue as gui
- [x] implement overview as in node 1652
      {didn't implement all of it, multiple swapchains is a feature for later}
	- [x] associate CommandGroup with swapchain (and the other way around?)
	- [x] allow something like "update from swapchain" in command buffer viewer?
	      It seems to me we want a more general "command source" concept
		  for the command buffer viewer. Could be queue/command buffer/command group/
		  swapchain/identified per-frame submission/fence-association or 
		  something like that.
- [x] add explicit "updateFromGroup" checkbox to command viewer
	- [x] we definitely need a "freeze" button. Would be same as unchecking
	      checkbox, so go with checkbox i guess
	- [x] do we also need an updateFromCb button?
		  {nvm, reworked cb update settings ui}
- [x] find a way to limit number of command groups. Erase them again if not
      used for a while. don't create group for single non-group cb submission?
	  Or somehow quickly remove again
- [x] barrier command inspectors: show information about all barriers, stage masks etc
	- [x] CmdPipelineBarrier
	- [x] CmdSetEvent
	- [x] CmdWaitEvents
- [x] destroying a sampler should also invalidate all records that use 
      a descriptor set allocated from a layout with that sampler bound as
	  immutable sampler. No idea how to properly do that, we need a link
	  sampler -> descriptorSetLayout and additionally 
	  descriptorSetLayout -> descriptorSet. Or maybe implicitly link
	  the sampler as soon as the descriptor set is created (from the layout,
	  in which it is linked) and then treat it as normal binding (that
	  is never invalidated, treat as special case)
	- [x] make sure to never read layout.pImmutableSamplers of an invalidated
	      record then. Destroying the immutable sampler would invalidate the
		  ds, causing the ds to be removed from the record.
- [x] fix command hook synchronization issue where we use a CommandHookState that is currently
      written to by a new application submission. I guess we simply have to add something like
	  "PendingSubmission* writerSubmission {}" to CommandHookState that is set every time
	  the state is used in a hooked submission and unset when the submission is finished.
	  When we then display (reading a buffer is fine, we copied them to separate memory
	  and are not using the mapped memory directly anyways) from a CommandHookState
	  and `writeSubmission` is set, we chain our gui draw behind it.
- [x] IMPORTANT! keep command group (or at least the hook?) alive 
	  while it is viewed in cb viewer? Can lead to problems currently.
	  Unset group in kept-alive records? We should probably keep the
	  group alive while a record of it is alive (but adding intrusive
	  pointer from record to group would create cycle).
	  Are currently getting crashed from this.
	- [x] re-enable discarding old command groups when this is figured out.
- [x] cleanup comments in rp.hpp. Currently a mess for splitting
- [x] debug gui.cpp:1316,1317 asserts sometimes failing (on window resize)
	  {we forget to check draw.inUse again before calling it in Gui::finishDraws)
- [x] setup CI for windows (msvc and mingw) and linux
- [x] better display (or completely hide?) swapchain images
	  We should probably fill-in Image::ci for them.
- [x] fix "unimplemented descriptor category" bug (not sure when it appears)
      {we were casting from descriptor type to descriptor category in stead
	   of using the function...}
- [x] Remove virtual stuff from CommandBufferHook 
- [x] optimization (important): when CommandRecord is invalidated (rather: removed as current
      recording from cb), it should destroy (reset) its hook as it 
	  will never be used again anyways
	  	- [x] see TODOs in CommandHookRecord (e.g. finish)
- [x] support integer-format images (needs different image display shader)
- [x] when checking if handle is used by cb, consider descriptor sets for images, buffers & bufferViews!
      when it's checked for an image/buffer, consider all descriptor of views as well.
- [x] copy vulkan headers to vk/. So we don't rely on system headers
- [x] remove src/bytes in favor of util/bytes.
- [x] move other util headers to util
- [x] A lot of sources can be moved to src/gui
	- [x] rename imguiutil. Move to gui
- [x] figure out why we can't name handles from inside the layer
	  {eh, see ugly workaround for now in device creation} 
- [x] fix ui for fixed resource tracking: check for nullptr resource references
      everywhere ~~(and use weak/shared pointer where we can't manually reset to null)~~
	- [x] use CommandBufferRecord::destroyed to show <destroyed> instead of
	      resource reference buttons
- [x] argumentsDesc for transfer commands (missing for a lot of commands rn)
- [x] fix nonCoherentAtom mapped memory flushing
- [x] fix/disable render pass splitting for transient attachments
	- [x] think of other cases where it might not work.
- [x] move old commandHook concept to docs/stash. Or just delete
      {last commit before remove: f140de13aed126311fb740530181af05cbc7a651}
- [x] before copying image in renderpass in commandHook, check if transferSrc
      is supported for image (we might not be able to set it in some cases)
	  	- [x] check for support in swapchain and image creation
- [x] cleanup, implement cb viewer as in node 1652
- [x] in overview: before showing pending submissions, we probably want to
      check them all for finish
- [x] fully implement command buffer viewer
	- [x] support all vulkan 1.0 commands (add to cb.h and commands.h)
	- [x] show all commands & info for commands
- [x] fix dummy buttons in command viewer (e.g. BeginRenderPass)
- [x] track dynamic graphics pipeline state
	- [x] show it in command ui
- [x] improve/cleanup pipeline time queries from querypool
	- [x] query whole-cb time, and correctly support querying for full renderpass
	- [x] we should probably show estimate of time range. The current values
	      often become meaningless on a per-command basis.
		  Also average them over multiple frames, avoid this glitchy look
- [x] properly implement layer querying functions
	- [x] version negotiation?
	- [x] implement vkEnumerateInstanceVersion, return lowest version we are confident to support.
		  maybe allow to overwrite this via environment variable (since, technically,
		  the layer will usually work fine even with the latest vulkan version)
		  EDIT: nope, that's not how it is done.	
- [x] restructure repo
	- [x] add an example (using swa)
	- [x] move everything else into src (maybe api.h to include/?)
	- [x] decide on license and add it
	      pro GPL: no one has to link this layer so it would not have a negative
		    impact on anyone. And using GPL it would prevent abusive usage (such as 
			forking/privately improving and selling it)
		  pro MIT: companies are probably still wary about using GPL software
		    and i totally don't have a problem with this being used for
			proprietary software development (such as games). 
			But otoh, companies not understanding licensing and open source 
			should not be my problem.
		  {yep, going with GPL for now}
- [x] always try to enable swapchain extension on device creation
- [x] name our internal handles for easier debugging
- [x] switch to shared pointers for device handles, keeping them alive
	  NOTE: nope, not doing that for now. Explicit resource connection tracking
	  implemented though.
- [x] store for handles in which command buffers they were used and set the
      command buffer to invalid state when they are changed/destroyed
- [x] cleanup Renderer/Gui implementation: merge back together
	- [x] proper gui sync implementation
	- [x] move gui tabs into own classes
- [x] display command buffer state in resource UI
- [x] use better enum->string helper. The vk_layer one has several problems
	  probably best to just modify their python script and put it into docs/.
	  Or use custom vkpp output generator?
	  {went with custom vkpp output generator, easy to write & maintain given
	   the extensive registry parser}
- [x] display in UI whether resources are destroyed or not
	  {NOTE: nvm, we decided against shared_ptr approach and never have destroyed resources}	
- [x] fix bug for cmdExecuteCommands when executed command buffers are invalid/destroyed
- [x] Remove Device::lastDevice api hack. Instead return a dev handle from fuenLoadApi
      Should probably just store it inside the api struct.
- [x] fix destructors: vulkan allows null handle, we don't
- [x] fix push constant tracking in command buffer
- [x] fix refCbs handling. We might not be able to do it that way.
- [x] rename cbState.hpp -> boundState.hpp? or just bound.hpp?
- [x] correctly handle secondary command buffers
	- [x] might need adaptions for render passes, bound state and such
		  {from a first look, no does not seem so. State is reset at cb boundary.
		   We just can't assume that something like cmdDraw is inside a render
		   pass for secondary cbs but we don't do that anyways}
- [x] Switch to a more useful fork/branch of vkpp: Generate vk::name
      functions for plain vulkan enums, don't use anything else here.
	  Probably best to not even include vkpp as subproject, just copy
	  /dispatch and /names here.
	  	- [x] nvm, should probably just ditch vkpp all together and use the layer utils
		- [x] check if we can use more of the the layer utils
		      maybe we can replace our own hash table?
			  {nah, not worth it for now, using std works fine, opt for later}
- [x] fix our global dispatchable handle hash table. Either use the vk_layer
	  one or remove the type hashing (dispatchable handles are globally unique).
- [x] we have to check in barrier commands whether the image (edit: or buffer) 
      was put into concurrent mode by us, and if so, set queue families to ignored
	  (otherwise it's a spec error)
- [x] correctly store pNext chain when recording command buffers.
      (alternative: at least set them to nullptr...)
- [x] improve UI
	- [x] Add proper image viewer
	- [x] Add buffer viewer
- [x] full support of all vulkan 1.0 commands (except sparse binding I guess)
	- [x] should probably also support the easy-to-support extensions
	      for resource creation already. At least widely used/important extensions
		  {yep, we should support the most critical 1.1 and 1.2 stuff, except descriptor update templates}
- [x] support descriptor update templates
- [x] properly shutdown everything, no leftover resources and layer warnings
- [x] proper queue creation and querying for window display
- [x] properly shut down rendering thread for own-window display
- [x] test display window for compute-only applications
	- [x] come up with something smart to block them before they shut down. 
	      Is there a sensible way to do this in the layer or should applications
		  do it themselves? **write wiki post**
		  We could simply block the application in vkDestroyDevice? but then,
		  everything is already destroyed I guess. Don't see a way to do it rn.
		  Applications otoh just have to insert a single std::getchar before

- [x] clean up currently slightly hacky window-thread communication.
      (and all instance stuff in layer.cpp)
      ~~investigate whether we have to create the display in that thread
	  on windows already as well~~
	- [x] related, swa/winapi: don't create dummy window when wgl is disabled?
	      (does not matter, isn't a problem with our fixed threading)
- [x] figure out a general policy to transitive handle-adding to command buffer
	- [x] e.g.: when an descriptor is used, is the imageView added to handles?
	      the image as well? the memory as well?
	      {yes, this is probably the expected and best way}
	- [x] add handles transitively for cmdExecuteCommands?
	      {yes, this is probably the expected and best way}
- [x] optimize memory consumption in cbs.
      the UsedHandle::commands vector are over-allocating *so much* currently,
	  maybe replace them with linked lists (non-intrusive)?
- [x] implement command group concept and last command buffer state viewing
